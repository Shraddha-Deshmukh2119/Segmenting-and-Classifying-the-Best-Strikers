# Segmenting and Classifying the Best Strikers

This project focuses on segmenting and classifying the top-performing strikers in football (soccer) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze performance metrics, group players with similar attributes, and identify the characteristics that define elite strikers.

## Overview

In this project, we:

- Analyzed performance data of football strikers.
- Applied clustering algorithms to segment players into groups based on their attributes.
- Used classification models to identify key traits that distinguish the best strikers.

This analysis can be beneficial for scouting talent, understanding player roles, and optimizing team composition.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about:

- Player performance metrics (e.g., goals scored, shots on target, pass accuracy).
- Physical and technical attributes (e.g., speed, dribbling, aerial ability).

**Source:** Provide details about where the data is sourced from (e.g., public datasets, Kaggle, FIFA stats, etc.).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Scaled and normalized data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized key performance metrics.
   - Analyzed correlations between attributes.

3. **Clustering:**
   - Applied K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to group players.
   - Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.

4. **Classification:**
   - Built machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify players as elite or non-elite.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Insights and Visualization:**
   - Generated actionable insights through charts and dashboards.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- **Clustering Insights:** Identified distinct groups of players with similar playing styles.
- **Classification Model:** Achieved [insert accuracy]% accuracy in predicting the best strikers.
- **Visualizations:** Created informative plots to display key findings.
